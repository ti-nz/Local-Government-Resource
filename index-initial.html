<h1 class="p-4 text-center">Transparency and Governance Road Trip</h1>
<p>The TINZ road trip is a journey through elements of local government leadership that are essential to the role. It is not a deep dive, but offers opportunities to learn and reflect.</p>
<h2>About the Resource</h2>
<p>We are asking newly elected officials to take this Road Trip because it is important. Transparency, good governance and accountability improve citizen participation, build trust and reduce corruption. Transparency is an important means for holding power into account.</p>
<p>The Road Trip consists of three parts that take approximately 15 minutes each. It is interactive with self evaluating quizzes along the way.</p>
<p>Local Government New Zealand is fully supportive of this resource.</p>
