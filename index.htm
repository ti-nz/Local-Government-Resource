<h2>About the Resource</h2>
<p>We are asking newly elected officials to take this Road Trip because it is important. Transparency, good governance and accountability improve citizen participation, build trust and reduce corruption. Transparency is an important means for holding power into account.</p>
<p>The Road Trip consists of three parts that take approximately 20 minutes each, recommended to be completed in three separate sessions in order to maximize their impact. The parts are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>Day 1: Openness, licence and motivation</li>      
<li>Day 2: Hands on the Wheel: Governance, ethics and integrity</li> 
<li>Day 3: Making Decisions</li> 
</ul>
<p>The course is interactive with self evaluating quizzes along the way.</p>
